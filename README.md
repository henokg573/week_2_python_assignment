# Week Two Assignment - Python List Operations
# By Henok Girma

## Description

This project demonstrates basic list operations in Python, as part of the Week Two Assignment. The script performs the following tasks:

1. Creates an empty list called `my_list`.
2. Appends the elements: `10`, `20`, `30`, and `40` to the list.
3. Inserts the value `15` at the second position (index 1).
4. Extends the list with another list: `[50, 60, 70]`.
5. Removes the last element from the list.
6. Sorts the list in ascending order.
7. Finds and prints the index of the value `30` in the list.

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed (latest version recommended). Then:

1. Clone this repository or download the Python main.py file.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python main.py
